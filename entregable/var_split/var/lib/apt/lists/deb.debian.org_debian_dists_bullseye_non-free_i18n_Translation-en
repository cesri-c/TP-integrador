Package: distributed-net
Description-md5: 477da522b2f82ac0fc58fa899167257f
Description-en: client to donate unused CPU cycles to distributed.net
 Donate your extra CPU cycles to a worthy cause!
 .
 distributed.net started in 1997 as a project whose purpose was to win a
 series of contests sponsored by RSA Data Security Inc., to crack their RC5
 encryption by brute-force methods. These contests were meant to show
 governments of nations such as the United States, who limit exports or
 use of cryptography, that the standards allowed are too weak for general
 use.
 .
 Since this time, distributed.net's focus has changed from solely
 cracking RSA's RC5 and DES projects to working on more diverse
 distributed computing problems.
 .
 The ongoing projects are RC5-72 and Optimal Golomb Rulers (28-mark), the
 latter of which has practical applications in science. There are also a
 number of other projects which are either periodic or upcoming. You may
 choose which project you wish to participate in.
 .
 Installing this package will allow unused CPU cycles on your computer to
 contribute to cracking the code. There should be no noticeable slowdown of
 your system, since the client runs niced, and only uses CPU time when
 your computer would otherwise be idle.

 Terrans, has developed means for space traveling, further fueled
 by the discovery of subspace which makes interstellar travel not
 only possible but also fast and easy. As a result the Terrans have
 expanded their territory, eventually encountering another bipedal,
 sentient species; the Vasudans. However, due to cultural differences
 and difficulties in communicating with each other, the Galactic Terran

 The HFS+ file system used by Apple Computer for their Mac OS is
 supported by the Linux kernel.  Apple provides mkfs and fsck for
 HFS+ with the Unix core of their operating system, Darwin.
 .
 This package is a port of Apple's tools for HFS+ filesystems.
 .
 For users, HFS+ seems to be a good compromise to carry files between
 MacOS X and Linux Machines, as HFS+ doesn't suffer the problems of
 FAT32 like:
 .
  * huge space waste (in slack space as devices grow faster);
  * ability to create files that are more than 4GB in size (especially
    good for those working with multimedia and that need to carry large
    ISO files);
  * ability to use case preserving (and even sensitivity!);
  * ability to use uid's and gid's on the filesystem.
 .
 Users in general can enjoy such benefits since it is expected to have
 more HFS+ filesystems in use, as Apple has announced Macintoshes for
 ix86-64, besides the filesystem being already supported by PowerPC
 systems since the beginning.

 DE6 is a male German diphone voice created in the context of the EU project
 NECA (IST-2000-28580), with the aim of being particularly suitable for the
 flexible synthesis of expressive speech.
 .
 The main feature of DE6 is therefore that it contains a complete diphone
 set for three different voice qualities defined by their vocal effort, low
 effort ("soft voice"), medium effort ("normal or modal voice"), and high
 effort ("loud voice").
 .
 This diphone database was recorded jointly by the Institute of Phonetics at
 Saarland University and by the Language Technology Department at DFKI,
 Saarbrücken.

Package: proj-rdnap
Description-md5: 56b7d4a3af661f6f4c745f395411f4c9
Description-en: RDNAP grid correction files for PROJ
 Kadaster and Rijkswaterstaat CIV, working together under the name RDNAP,
 developed RDNAPTRANS™2008, the precise and official transformation
 between ETRS89 and the dutch national horizontal and vertical coordinate
 reference systems the Stelsel van de Rijksdriehoeksmeting (RD) and the
 Normaal Amsterdams Peil (NAP). A ‘simplified’ procedure has been
 developed which uses a NTv2-grid for the transformation between ETRS89
 and RD as well as a VDatum-grid for the transformation between ETRS89
 and NAP. This ‘simplified’ procedure has the following limitations:
 .
  1) The rdtrans2008 NTv2-grid can only give identical results to
     RDNAPTRANS™2008 within 1 millimeter at ground level onshore and at
     mean sea level offshore. The horizontal deviation is approximately
     1 millimeter per 50 meter height difference from ground level or mean
     sea level.
  2) An exception to 1) is the border of the RDNAPTRANS™2008 correction
     grid. Transformation results within cells of the rdtrans2008 NTv2-grid
     that are intersected by the border of the RDNAPTRANS™2008 correction
     grid can result in deviations of up to 20 centimeter.
  3) The naptrans2008 VDatum-grid cannot be used to determine deflections
     of the vertical. For this the NLGEO2004 geoid model has to be used.
  4) The naptrans2008 VDatum-grid is referenced to the Bessel-1841 ellipsoid
     and cannot be used stand-alone, it has to be used in combination with
     the rdtrans2008 NTv2-grid.
 .
 Taking into account the limitations listed above, the rdtrans2008 NTv2-grid
 and naptrans2008 VDatum-grid can be used as an alternative to
 RDNAPTRANS™2008 to transform geographic ETRS89-coordinates to
 projected RD-coordinates with grid correction applied and NAP-heights.
 .
 Note that, although the resulting RD/NAP and ETRS89 coordinates from the
 transformation will be correct, geographic Bessel-1841 coordinates will
 differ in both procedures and should only be considered as an intermediate
 result.
 .
 RDNAPTRANS™2018 contains a new datum transformation based on the updated
 ETRS89 coordinates of realisation ETRF2000(R14). Next to this, a new and
 slightly more precise quasi-geoid grid model is used. This NLGEO2018
 quasi-geoid model covers a larger area including a large part of the North
 Sea. A change with big impact is the use of a new data format of the grid
 files and a corresponding transformation procedure that changes the order
 of the steps of the transformation and uses a fixed height in the datum
 transformation. As a result, the transformation is now possible conform a
 de facto standard by including the datum transformation in the correction
 grid (variant 2). This allows straightforward implementation in software
 like GIS packages and can resolve current problems due to incorrect
 implementations of the transformation.
 .
 Within the administrative borders of the Netherlands, the differences in
 the resulting horizontal coordinates due to the changes from version 2008
 to 2018 of RDNAPTRANS™ are at maximum 0.010 m at sea level (zero NAP
 height), and at maximum an additional 0.001 m per 50 m height above or
 below zero NAP height. The maximum change in the transformed height
 coordinates due to the slightly more precise new quasi-geoid grid model
 is about 0.025 m. The new correction grid has a different sampling in
 ellipsoidal coordinates. With this resampling, discontinuities in the
 correction grid are smoothed, especially outside the administrative
 borders of the Netherlands, to allow bilinear interpolation. As a result,
 changes in the resulting horizontal coordinates up to 0.05 m occur
 occasionally in Belgium, Germany and the Dutch EEZ. To use the same
 bounding box around the Netherlands including the Dutch EEZ of the
 North Sea of the quasi-geoid grid model for the correction grid, the
 correction grid has been faded out to zero correction for a seamless
 land-sea transition. This introduces latitude and longitude corrections
 up to 0.25 m in areas outside the former validity area of RDNAPTRANS™
 where no corrections were defined before.
 .
 There are two variants for the implementation of RDNAPTRANS™2018.
 Implementation variant 1 applies the datum transformation as a separate
 step using a 3D similarity transformation. Implementation variant 2
 includes the datum transformation in the correction grid and a different
 quasi-geoid grid for the height transformation is used. The advantage of
 implementation variant 1 is that it has no strict bounds for the area
 where horizontal coordinates can be transformed correctly. The
 disadvantage is that many software packages do not support
 implementation variant 1. Implementation variant 2 is supported by more
 software but can only be used within the bounds of the correction grid.
 The difference in the resulting coordinates between the two variants is
 well below 0.0010 m within the bounds of the RDNAPTRANS™2008 grids.
 Although transformation at sea and even outside the grid bounds is
 possible, the scale factor of the map projection increases rapidly and
 also the precision of transformation back and forth deteriorates. There
 are bounds to the recommended use of RD and NAP at sea and outside the
 Netherlands.

Package: seq-gen
Description-md5: ec6271f8ee17a85b9c6bc9e309d6343f
Description-en: simulate the evolution of nucleotide or amino acid sequences
 Seq-Gen is a program that will simulate the evolution of nucleotide
 or amino acid sequences along a phylogeny, using common models of the
 substitution process. A range of models of molecular evolution are
 implemented including the general reversible model. State frequencies
 and other parameters of the model may be given and site-specific rate
 heterogeneity may also be incorporated in a number of ways. Any number
 of trees may be read in and the program will produce any number of data
 sets for each tree. Thus large sets of replicate simulations can be
 easily created. It has been designed to be a general purpose simulator
 that incorporates most of the commonly used
 (and computationally tractable) models of molecular sequence evolution.

Description-md5: 7788bf12148938f8dc8e4675657ce605
Description-en: predicts if a substitution in a protein has a phenotypic effect
 SIFT is a sequence homology-based tool that sorts intolerant from tolerant
 amino acid substitutions and predicts whether an amino acid substitution
 in a protein will have a phenotypic effect. SIFT is based on the premise
 that protein evolution is correlated with protein function. Positions
 important for function should be conserved in an alignment of the protein
 family, whereas unimportant positions should appear diverse in an alignment.

 .
 SiSU is a lightweight markup based, command line oriented, document
 structuring, publishing and search framework for document collections.
 .
 With minimal preparation of a plain-text, (UTF-8) file, using its native
 markup syntax in your text editor of choice, SiSU can generate various
 document formats (most of which share a common object numbering system for
 locating content), including plain text, HTML, XHTML, XML, EPUB, OpenDocument
 text (ODF:ODT), LaTeX, PDF files, and populate an SQL database with objects
 (roughly paragraph-sized chunks) so searches may be performed and matches
 returned with that degree of granularity: your search criteria is met by these
 documents and at these locations within each document. Object numbering is
 particularly suitable for "published" works (finalized texts as opposed to
 works that are frequently changed or updated) for which it provides a fixed
 means of reference of content. Document outputs also share semantic meta-data
 provided.
 .
 SiSU also provides concordance files, document content certificates and
 manifests of generated output.
 .
 man pages, and interactive help are provided.
 .
 Dependencies for additional features are taken care of in sisu related
 packages.
 .
 The dummy package sisu-complete together with sisu-markup-samples installs
 the whole of SiSU.

Package: snaphu
Description-md5: bd83ead653bb3db50cb0e6dcb869f8bb
Description-en: Statistical-Cost, Network-Flow Algorithm for 2D Phase Unwrapping
 Two-dimensional phase unwrapping is the process of recovering
 unambiguous phase data from a 2-D array of phase values known only
 modulo 2pi rad.
 .
 There are many applications, like Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI),
 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), fringe pattern analysis, tomography
 and spectroscopy, which as part of their fundamental operation depend
 upon the extraction of a phase signal from their input image. Usually
 the phase is available in a form that suffers from 2-pi phase jumps
 due to the use of the mathematical arctangent function, which produces
 an inherently wrapped output. This wrapped phase is unusable until the
 phase discontinuities are removed.
 .
 SNAPHU is an implementation of the Statistical-cost, Network-flow
 Algorithm for Phase Unwrapping particularly suitable for SAR
 interferometry applications. This algorithm poses phase unwrapping as
 a maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) estimation problem, the
 objective of which is to compute the most likely unwrapped solution
 given the observable input data. Because the statistics relating the
 input data to the solution depend on the measured quantity, SNAPHU
 incorporates three built-in statistical models, for topography data,
 deformation data, and smooth generic data. The posed optimization
 problem is solved approximately with use of network-flow techniques.
 .
 As SNAPHU uses an iterative optimization procedure, its execution time
 depends on the difficulty of the interferogram. In single-tile mode
 the required memory is on the order of 100 MB per 1000000 pixels in
 the input interferogram.

 trn is a threaded news reader with a long history, descended from Larry
 Wall's rn (part of the second generation of newsreaders).  It has a
 powerful full screen text mode user interface, where most actions are
 available at the press of a single key.  It is highly configurable.
 .
 This version of trn reads news from a news server via NNTP (the Network
 News Transfer Protocol).  You must have a news server available - large
 sites usually provide a site-wide server.
 .
 If you install a news server on your system (either containing just
 local newsgroups or with a partial or full USENET feed) you can
 configure trn to access it.  In this case you will also need to install
 an appropriate 'inews' package for local posting.
 .
 This is a separate package from trn because trn 4.0 has enough
 substantial changes in its default behaviour (for instance, the group
 selector is new in 4.0) that some users prefer to stay with an older
 version of trn.

Package: vienna-rna
Description-md5: cd4926e923e0b58439a80df654cba8f9
Description-en: RNA sequence analysis
 The Vienna RNA Package consists of a C code library and several
 stand-alone programs for the prediction and comparison of RNA secondary
 structures. It is developed and maintained by the group of Ivo Hofacker
 in Vienna.
 .
 RNA secondary structure prediction through energy minimization is the
 most used function in the package. It provides three kinds of dynamic
 programming algorithms for structure prediction:
  * the minimum free energy algorithm of (Zuker & Stiegler 1981) which
    yields a single optimal structure,
  * the partition function algorithm of (McCaskill 1990) which calculates
    base pair probabilities in the thermodynamic ensemble, and the
    suboptimal folding algorithm of (Wuchty et.al 1999) which generates
    all suboptimal structures within a given energy range of the optimal
    energy.
 .
 For secondary structure comparison, the package contains several
 measures of distance (dissimilarities) using either string alignment or
 tree-editing (Shapiro & Zhang 1990). Finally, is provided an algorithm
 to design sequences with a predefined structure (inverse folding).
 The RNAforester package is a tool for aligning RNA secondary structures
 and it's user interface integrates to those of the tools of the
 Vienna RNA package.
