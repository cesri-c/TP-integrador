 Amanda is a backup system designed to archive many computers on a
 network to a single large-capacity tape drive. This package is
 suitable for large amounts of data to backup. For smaller solutions
 take a look at afbackup, tob, ...
 .
  Features:
   * will back up multiple machines in parallel to a holding disk, blasting
     finished dumps one by one to tape as fast as they can be can written to
     tape.  For example, a ~2 Gb 8mm tape on a ~240K/s interface to a host
     with a large holding disk can be filled by Amanda in under 4 hours.
   * built on top of standard backup software: Unix dump/restore, and
     later GNU Tar and others.
   * does simple tape management: will not overwrite the wrong tape.
   * supports tape changers via a generic interface.  Easily customizable
     to any type of tape carousel, robot, or stacker that can be controlled
     via the unix command line.
   * for a restore, tells you what tapes you need, and finds the proper
     backup image on the tape for you.
   * recovers gracefully from errors, including down or hung machines.
   * reports results, including all errors in detail, in email to operators.
   * will dynamically adjust backup schedule to keep within constraints:
     no more juggling by hand when adding disks and computers to network.
   * includes a pre-run checker program, that conducts sanity checks on both
     the tape server host and all the client hosts (in parallel), and will
     send an e-mail report of any problems that could cause the backups to
     fail.
   * can compress dumps before sending or after sending over the net, with
     either compress or gzip.
   * can optionally synchronize with external backups, for those large
     timesharing computers where you want to do full dumps when the system
     is down in single-user mode (since BSD dump is not reliable on active
     filesystems): Amanda will still do your daily dumps.
   * lots of other options; Amanda is very configurable.

Description-en: Apache Log4j - Logging Framework for Java
 Apache Log4j 2 is an upgrade to Log4j that provides significant improvements
 over its predecessor, Log4j 1.x:
 .
 API Separation: The API for Log4j is separate from the implementation making
 it clear for application developers which classes and methods they can use
 while ensuring forward compatibility.
 .
 Improved Performance: Log4j 2 contains next-generation Asynchronous Loggers
 based on the LMAX Disruptor library. In multi-threaded scenarios Asynchronous
 Loggers have 10 times higher throughput and orders of magnitude lower latency
 than Log4j 1.x.
 .
 Support for multiple APIs: While the Log4j 2 API will provide the best
 performance, Log4j 2 provides support for the SLF4J and Commons Logging APIs.
 .
 Automatic Reloading of Configurations: Log4j 2 can automatically reload its
 configuration upon modification. It will do so without losing log events
 while reconfiguration is taking place.
 .
 Advanced Filtering: Log4j 2 supports filtering based on context
 data, markers, regular expressions, and other components in the Log event.
 Filtering can be specified to apply to all events before being passed to
 Loggers or as they pass through Appenders.
 .
 Plugin Architecture: Log4j uses the plugin pattern to configure components.
 As such, no code is needed to create and configure an Appender, Layout,
 Pattern Converter, and so on. Log4j automatically recognizes plugins
 and uses them when a configuration references them.
 .
 Property Support: Properties can be referenced in a configuration, Log4j will
 directly replace them, or Log4j will pass them to an underlying component that
 will dynamically resolve them. Properties come from values defined in the
 configuration file, system properties, environment variables, the
 ThreadContext Map, and data present in the event.

Description-en: Analyze, create, and manipulate (binary) Java class files
 The Byte Code Engineering Library is intended to give users a convenient
 possibility to analyze, create, and manipulate (binary) Java class files
 (those ending with .class). Classes are represented by objects which contain
 all the symbolic information of the given class: methods, fields and byte
 code instructions, in particular.
 .
 Such objects can be read from an existing file, be transformed by a program
 (e.g. a class loader at run-time) and dumped to a file again. An even more
 interesting application is the creation of classes from scratch at run-time.
 The Byte Code Engineering Library (BCEL) may be also useful if you want to
 learn about the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and the format of Java .class

 their full-featured GNU cousins; however, the options that are included
 provide the expected functionality and behave very much like their GNU
 counterparts.
 .
 This package installs the BusyBox binary but does not install

Package: busybox-syslogd
Description-md5: 6d204aacbcadc9711030ab99f904ca3b
Description-en: Provides syslogd and klogd using busybox
 The system log daemon is responsible for providing logging of
 messages received from programs and facilities on the local host as
 well as from remote hosts.
 .
 The kernel log daemon listens to kernel message sources and is
 responsible for prioritizing and processing operating system
 messages.
 .
 The busybox implementation of the syslogd is particular useful on
 embedded, diskless (netboot) or flash disk based systems because it
 can use a fixed size ring buffer for logging instead of saving logs
 to the disk or sending it to remote logging servers. The ring buffer
 can be read using the (also busybox based) command logread.
 .
 This package provides the glue to the busybox syslogd and klogd to be
 used in the system by providing the appropriate symbolic links and
 scripts.

Description-en: powerful TeX format
 ConTeXt is a document-production system based, like LaTeX, on the TeX
 typesetting system.  Whereas LaTeX insulates the writer from
 typographical details, ConTeXt takes a complementary approach by
 providing structured interfaces for handling typography, including
 extensive support for colors, backgrounds, hyperlinks, presentations,
 figure-text integration, and conditional compilation.  It gives the
 user extensive control over formatting while making it easy to create
 new layouts and styles without learning the TeX macro language.
 ConTeXt's unified design averts the package clashes that can happen
 with LaTeX.
 .
 ConTeXt also integrates MetaFun, a superset of MetaPost and a powerful
 system for vector graphics.  MetaFun can be used as a stand-alone
 system to produce figures, but its strength lies in enhancing ConTeXt
 documents with accurate graphic elements.
 .
 ConTeXt allows the users to specify formatting commands in English,
 Dutch, German, French, or Italian, and to use different typesetting
 engines (PDFTeX, XeTeX, Aleph, and soon LuaTeX) without changing the
 user interface.  ConTeXt is developed rapidly, often in response to
 requests from the friendly user community.

Description-en: simple interprocess messaging system (systemd --user integration)
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 On systemd systems, this package opts in to the session model in which
 a user's session starts the first time they log in, and does not end
 until all their login sessions have ended. This model merges all
 parallel non-graphical login sessions (text mode, ssh, cron, etc.), and up
 to one graphical session, into a single "user-session" or "super-session"
 within which all background D-Bus services are shared.
 .
 Multiple graphical sessions per user are not currently supported in this
 mode; as a result, it is particularly suitable for gdm, which responds to
 requests to open a parallel graphical session by switching to the existing
 graphical session and unlocking it.
 .
 To retain dbus' traditional session semantics, in which login sessions
 are artificially isolated from each other, remove this package and install
 dbus-x11 instead.

 FFmpeg is the leading multimedia framework, able to decode, encode, transcode,
 mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty much anything that humans and
 machines have created. It supports the most obscure ancient formats up to the
 cutting edge.
 .
 This library provides performs highly optimized audio resampling, rematrixing
 and sample format conversion operations.
 Specifically, this library performs the following conversions:
  * Resampling is the process of changing the audio rate, for example from a
    high sample rate of 44100Hz to 8000Hz. Audio conversion from high to low
    sample rate is a lossy process. Several resampling options and algorithms
    are available.
  * Rematrixing is the process of changing the channel layout, for example from
    stereo to mono. When the input channels cannot be mapped to the output
    streams, the process is lossy, since it involves different gain factors
    and mixing. Various other audio conversions (e.g. stretching and padding)
    are enabled through dedicated options.
  * Format conversion is the process of converting the type of samples, for
    example from 16-bit signed samples to unsigned 8-bit or float samples.
    It also handles packing conversion, when passing from packed layout (all
    samples belonging to distinct channels interleaved in the same buffer), to
    planar layout (all samples belonging to the same channel stored in a
    dedicated buffer or "plane").

Package: flatpak
Description-md5: f91acb1d2880527b2759bc5e2d99fbff
Description-en: Application deployment framework for desktop apps
 Flatpak installs, manages and runs sandboxed desktop application bundles.
 Application bundles run partially isolated from the wider system, using
 containerization techniques such as namespaces to prevent direct access
 to system resources. Resources from outside the sandbox can be accessed
 via "portal" services, which are responsible for access control; for
 example, the Documents portal displays an "Open" dialog outside the
 sandbox, then allows the application to access only the selected file.
 .
 Each application uses a specified "runtime", or set of libraries, which is
 available as /usr inside its sandbox. This can be used to run application
 bundles with multiple, potentially incompatible sets of dependencies within
 the same desktop environment.
 .
 This package contains the services and executables needed to install and
 launch sandboxed applications, and the portal services needed to provide
 limited access to resources outside the sandbox.

Package: graphicsmagick
Description-md5: 49dce754c724afc2a734936e7250be4b
Description-en: collection of image processing tools
 GraphicsMagick provides a set of command-line applications to manipulate
 image files. It is a fork of the ImageMagick project and therefore offers
 a similar set of features, but puts a larger emphasis on stability.
 .
 The tools support a large variety of image formats from the widely used
 jpeg, tiff, bmp or xpm to special-purpose formats such as fits or image
 formats found on some photo CDs. They can convert between formats,
 concatenate several images into one, annotate and distort them, create
 thumbnails or manipulate the colormap. While all features are available
 from the command-line, the package also includes an image viewer that
 allows interactive manipulation.
 .
 Note that unlike ImageMagick, the GraphicsMagick tools are accessed
 through a single executable called 'gm'. Therefore, GraphicsMagick and
 ImageMagick can be used in parallel. Install package
 graphicsmagick-imagemagick-compat to obtain a set of several executables
 that is compatible to ImageMagick's interface.

 GraphicsMagick provides libraries in several programming languages to read,
 write and manipulate image files across a large number of formats, from the
 widely used jpeg, tiff, bmp or xpm to special-purpose formats such as fits or
 image formats found on some photo CDs. There are functions for finegrained
 image processing tasks, as well as conversion routines between the various
 image formats.
 .
 The GraphicsMagick library is a fork of ImageMagick and therefore offers
 an interface that is similar in features, but intended to be more stable
 across releases. While compatibility does not go so far that the
 GraphicsMagick library serves as a drop-in replacement for ImageMagick,

 small differences, experience tells that many programs only use a compatible
 subset and build fine with either GraphicsMagick or ImageMagick.

 While GraphicsMagick uses different names for libraries, classes, and
 helper applications in order to coexist with ImageMagick, this package
 intends to minimise porting efforts by exporting the GraphicsMagick
 interface with the usual ImageMagick names. Note that this package only
 tries to provide build-time compatibility. Run-time libraries of
 ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick are incompatible and cannot be interchanged.

 make the global functionality of a protocol accessible (e.g., TFTP send
 file and receive file) when possible, but also provide access to the
 fundamental protocols where applicable so that a programmer may construct
 his own custom implementations (e.g, the TFTP packet classes and the TFTP
 packet send and receive methods are exposed).

Description-en: Apache Commons Net (API documentation)
 The Apache Commons Net library implements the client side of many basic
 Internet protocols. The purpose of the library is to provide fundamental
 protocol access, not higher-level abstractions. Therefore, some of the
 design violates object-oriented design principles. The philosophy is to
 make the global functionality of a protocol accessible (e.g., TFTP send
 file and receive file) when possible, but also provide access to the
 fundamental protocols where applicable so that a programmer may construct
 his own custom implementations (e.g, the TFTP packet classes and the TFTP
 packet send and receive methods are exposed).

 This package contains the API documentation for libcommons-net-java.

Package: libdata-entropy-perl
Description-md5: bf232b9f932cc0e331c5707daf63a17a
Description-en: Perl module for entropy (randomness) management
 Data::Entropy maintains a concept of a current selection of entropy source.
 Algorithms that require entropy can use the source nominated by this
 module, avoiding the need for entropy source objects to be explicitly
 passed around.  This is convenient because usually one entropy source
 will be used for an entire program run and so an explicit entropy source
 parameter would rarely vary.  There is also a default entropy source,
 avoiding the need to explicitly configure a source at all.
 .
 If nothing is done to set a source then it defaults to the use of Rijndael
 (AES) in counter mode (see Data::Entropy::RawSource::CryptCounter
 and Crypt::Rijndael), keyed using Perl's built-in rand function.
 This gives a data stream that looks like concentrated entropy, but really
 only has at most the entropy of the rand seed.  Within a single run it
 is cryptographically difficult to detect the correlation between parts
 of the pseudo-entropy stream.  If more true entropy is required then it
 is necessary to configure a different entropy source.

Description-en: module for removing scripts from HTML
 HTML::StripScripts is a Perl module for neutralizes scripting constructs in
 HTML, leaving as much non-scripting markup in place as possible. This allows
 web applications to display HTML originating from an untrusted source without
 introducing cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
 .
 The process is based on whitelists of tags, attributes and attribute values.
 This approach is the most secure against disguised scripting constructs hidden
 in malicious HTML documents.
 .
 As well as removing scripting constructs, this module ensures that there is a
 matching end for each start tag, and that the tags are properly nested.

 You will probably use HTML::StripScripts::Parser rather than using this module
 directly (see libhtml-stripscripts-parser-perl).

Package: libxstream-java
Description-md5: 10c1dedc8716f96d83e51d094ab4032b
Description-en: Java library to serialize objects to XML and back again
 The features of the XStream library are:
 .
  - Ease of use. A high level facade is supplied that simplifies common
    use cases.
  - No mappings required. Most objects can be serialized without need
    for specifying mappings.
  - Performance. Speed and low memory footprint are a crucial part of
    the design, making it suitable for large object graphs or systems
    with high message throughput.
  - Clean XML. No information is duplicated that can be obtained via
    reflection. This results in XML that is easier to read for humans
    and more compact than native Java serialization.
  - Requires no modifications to objects. Serializes internal fields,
    including private and final. Supports non-public and inner classes.
    Classes are not required to have default constructor.
  - Full object graph support. Duplicate references encountered in the
    object-model will be maintained. Supports circular references.
  - Integrates with other XML APIs. By implementing an interface,
    XStream can serialize directly to/from any tree structure (not just
    XML).
  - Customizable conversion strategies. Strategies can be registered
    allowing customization of how particular types are represented as
    XML.
  - Error messages. When an exception occurs due to malformed XML,
    detailed diagnostics are provided to help isolate and fix the
    problem.
  - Alternative output format. The modular design allows other output
    formats. XStream ships currently with JSON support and morphing.

 Metadata consist of information that characterizes data. Metadata are
 used to provide documentation for data products. In essence, metadata
 answer who, what, when, where, why, and how about every facet of the

 Metadata within a file can tell a lot about you. Cameras record data
 about when a picture was taken and what camera was used. Office
 documents like PDF or Office automatically adds author and company
 information to documents and spreadsheets.
 .
 Maybe you don't want to disclose those information.
 .
 mat2 only removes metadata from your files, it does not anonymise their
 content, nor can it handle watermarking, steganography, or any too
 custom metadata field/system.

 If you really want to be anonymous, use file formats that do not contain
 any metadata, or better: use plain-text.

   * Audit log; store full request details in a separate file, including POST
     payloads.
   * Request filtering; incoming requests can be analysed and offensive requests
     can be rejected (or simply logged, if that is what you want). This feature
     can be used to prevent many types of attacks (e.g. XSS attacks, SQL
     injection, ...) and even allow you to run insecure applications on your
     servers (if you have no other choice, of course).

 As the Debian packages switched to Python 3, it isn't possible to run using
 Eventlet (ie: the standalone neutron-server daemon) if we use SSL, because of
 defects in python3-eventlet. So the Debian package maitainer decided to switch
 to uwsgi instead. In this mode, one needs to also run neutron-rpc-server to
 listen for requests on the message bus (ie: rabbitmq in most cases). For this
 reason, the neutron-server package has been split into neutron-api and
 neutron-rpc-server.

 @babel/standalone provides a standalone build of Babel for use in browsers
 and other non-Node.js environments.If you're using Babel in production, you
 should normally not use @babel/standalone. Instead, you should use a build
 system running on Node.js, such as Webpack, Rollup, or Parcel, to transpile
 your JS ahead of time.
 .
 However, there are some valid use cases for @babel/standalone:
  * It provides an easy, convenient way to prototype with Babel. Using
    @babel/standalone, you can get started using Babel with just a simple
    script tag in your HTML.
  * Sites that compile user-provided JavaScript in real-time, like JSFiddle,
    JS Bin, the REPL on the Babel site, JSitor, etc.
  * Apps that embed a JavaScript engine such as V8 directly, and want to use
    Babel for compilation
  * Apps that want to use JavaScript as a scripting language for extending the
    app itself, including all the goodies that ES2015 provides.
  * Other non-Node.js environments (ReactJS.NET, ruby-babel-transpiler,
    php-babel-transpiler, etc).

Description-en: Library for reading and writing images - development
 OpenImageIO is a library for reading and writing images, and a bunch of
 related classes, utilities, and applications. Main features include:
 .
  * Extremely simple but powerful ImageInput and ImageOutput APIs for reading
    and writing 2D images that is format agnostic -- that is, a "client app"
    doesn't need to know the details about any particular image file formats.
    Specific formats are implemented by DLL/DSO plugins.
 .
  * Format plugins for TIFF, JPEG/JFIF, OpenEXR, PNG, HDR/RGBE, Targa,
    JPEG-2000, DPX, Cineon, FITS, BMP, ICO, RMan Zfile, Softimage PIC, DDS,
    SGI, PNM/PPM/PGM/PBM, Field3d, WebP. More coming! The plugins are really
    good at understanding all the strange corners of the image formats, and
    are very careful about preserving image metadata (including Exif, GPS, and
    IPTC data).
 .
  * An ImageCache class that transparently manages a cache so that it can access
    truly vast amounts of image data (thousands of image files totaling hundreds
    of GB) very efficiently using only a tiny amount (tens of megabytes at most)
    of runtime memory. Additionally, a TextureSystem class provides filtered
    MIP-map texture lookups, atop the nice caching behavior of ImageCache.
 .
  * Several image tools based on these classes, including iinfo (print detailed
    info about images), iconvert (convert among formats, data types, or modify
    metadata), idiff (compare images),igrep (search images for matching
    metadata). Because these tools are based on ImageInput/ImageOutput, they
    work with any image formats for which ImageIO plugins are available.
 .
  * A really nice image viewer, iv, also based on OpenImageIO classes (and so
    will work with any formats for which plugins are available).
 .
  * Supported on Linux, OS X, and Windows.

 that pgpool-II is the actual PostgreSQL server, and the server (backend) sees
 pgpool-II as one of its clients. Because pgpool-II is transparent to both the
 server and the client, an existing database application can be used with
 pgpool-II almost without a change to its sources.

 QEMU is a fast processor emulator. Once upon a time there was only one
 package named `qemu', with all functionality included. These days, qemu
 become large and has been split into numerous packages. Different packages
 provides entirely different services, and it is very unlikely one will
 need all of them together. So current `qemu' package makes no sense anymore,
 and is becoming a dummy package.
 .
 If you want full system emulation of some architecture, install one or more
 of qemu-system-ARCH packages. If you want user-mode emulation, install
 qemu-user or qemu-user-static package. If you need utilities, use qemu-utils
 package.
 .
 This package can safely be removed.

  * In case of node failures, CTDB will automatically recover and repair all TDB
    databases that it manages.
  * CTDB is the core component that provides pCIFS ("parallel CIFS") with
    Samba3/4.
  * CTDB provides HA features such as node monitoring, node failover, and IP
    takeover.

    with CTDB to communicate to other instances of the application running on
    different nodes in the cluster.
  * CTDB has pluggable transport backends. Currently implemented backends are
    TCP and Infiniband.
  * CTDB supports a system of application specific management scripts, allowing
    applications that depend on network or filesystem resources to be managed in

Description-en: distributed virtual object store - Python 3 libraries
 OpenStack Object Storage (code-named Swift) creates redundant, scalable object
 storage using clusters of standardized servers to store petabytes of
 accessible data. It is not a file system or real-time data storage system, but
 rather a long-term storage system for a more permanent type of static data
 that can be retrieved, leveraged, and then updated if necessary. Primary
 examples of data that best fit this type of storage model are virtual machine
 images, photo storage, email storage and backup archiving. Having no central
 "brain" or master point of control provides greater scalability, redundancy
 and permanence.
 .
 Objects are written to multiple hardware devices in the data center, with
 the OpenStack software responsible for ensuring data replication and
 integrity across the cluster. Storage clusters can scale horizontally by
 adding new nodes. Should a node fail, OpenStack works to replicate its
 content from other active nodes. Because OpenStack uses software logic to
 ensure data replication and distribution across different devices,
 inexpensive commodity hard drives and servers can be used in lieu of more
 expensive equipment.

Package: tor
Description-md5: 9106e8e4b3843ebd532ba2b89615a92e
Description-en: anonymizing overlay network for TCP
 Tor is a connection-based low-latency anonymous communication system.
 .
 Clients choose a source-routed path through a set of relays, and
 negotiate a "virtual circuit" through the network, in which each relay
 knows its predecessor and successor, but no others. Traffic flowing
 down the circuit is decrypted at each relay, which reveals the
 downstream relay.
 .
 Basically, Tor provides a distributed network of relays. Users bounce
 their TCP streams (web traffic, ftp, ssh, etc) around the relays, and
 recipients, observers, and even the relays themselves have difficulty
 learning which users connected to which destinations.
 .
 This package enables only a Tor client by default, but it can also be
 configured as a relay and/or a hidden service easily.
 .
 Client applications can use the Tor network by connecting to the local
 socks proxy interface provided by your Tor instance. If the application
 itself does not come with socks support, you can use a socks client
 such as torsocks.
 .
 Note that Tor does no protocol cleaning on application traffic. There
 is a danger that application protocols and associated programs can be
 induced to reveal information about the user. Tor depends on Torbutton
 and similar protocol cleaners to solve this problem. For best
 protection when web surfing, the Tor Project recommends that you use
 the Tor Browser Bundle, a standalone tarball that includes static
 builds of Tor, Torbutton, and a modified Firefox that is patched to fix
 a variety of privacy bugs.

Package: tor-geoipdb
Description-md5: d0b50c9cd91157b8c85856fd55e26d14
Description-en: GeoIP database for Tor
 This package provides a GeoIP database for Tor, i.e. it maps IPv4 addresses
 to countries.
 .
 Bridge relays (special Tor relays that aren't listed in the main Tor
 directory) use this information to report which countries they see
 connections from.  These statistics enable the Tor network operators to
 learn when certain countries start blocking access to bridges.
 .
 Clients can also use this to learn what country each relay is in, so
 Tor controllers like arm or Vidalia can use it, or if they want to
 configure path selection preferences.

Package: trafficserver

 .
   * Caching: improve response time while reducing server load and bandwidth
     needs by caching and reusing frequently-requested web pages, images, and
     web service calls.
   * Proxying: add keep-alive, filter or anonymize content requests, or add
     load balancing by adding a proxy layer.
   * Scaling: handle 10s of thousands of requests per second on modern SMP
     hardware.

Description-md5: 83e3ff2859524c831253d938da348878
Description-en: Update Configuration File(s): preserve user changes to config files
 Debian policy mandates that user changes to configuration files must be
 preserved during package upgrades. The easy way to achieve this behavior
 is to make the configuration file a 'conffile', in which case dpkg
 handles the file specially during upgrades, prompting the user as
 needed.
 .
 This is appropriate only if it is possible to distribute a default
 version that will work for most installations, although some system
 administrators may choose to modify it. This implies that the
 default version will be part of the package distribution, and must
 not be modified by the maintainer scripts during installation (or at
 any other time).
 .
 This script attempts to provide conffile-like handling for files that
 may not be labelled conffiles, and are not shipped in a Debian package,
 but handled by the postinst instead. This script allows one to
 maintain files in /etc, preserving user changes and in general
 offering the same facilities while upgrading that dpkg normally
 provides for 'conffiles'.
 .
 Additionally, this script provides facilities for transitioning a
 file that had not been provided with conffile-like protection to come
 under this schema, and attempts to minimize questions asked at
 installation time. Indeed, the transitioning facility is better than the
 one offered by dpkg while transitioning a file from a non-conffile to
 conffile status.

Description-md5: 63a4a740bcd9e8e94bf661e4f1806e02
Description-en: retrieves files from the web
 Wget is a network utility to retrieve files from the web
 using HTTP(S) and FTP, the two most widely used internet
 protocols. It works non-interactively, so it will work in
 the background, after having logged off. The program supports
 recursive retrieval of web-authoring pages as well as FTP
 sites -- you can use Wget to make mirrors of archives and
 home pages or to travel the web like a WWW robot.
 .
 Wget works particularly well with slow or unstable connections
 by continuing to retrieve a document until the document is fully
 downloaded. Re-getting files from where it left off works on
 servers (both HTTP and FTP) that support it. Both HTTP and FTP
 retrievals can be time stamped, so Wget can see if the remote
 file has changed since the last retrieval and automatically
 retrieve the new version if it has.
 .
 Wget supports proxy servers; this can lighten the network load,
 speed up retrieval, and provide access behind firewalls.

 display device(s). It provides multi-head X functionality for displays that
 might be located on different machines. Xdmx functions as a front-end X server
 that acts as a proxy to a set of back-end X servers. All of the visible
 rendering is passed to the back-end X servers. Clients connect to the Xdmx
 front-end, and everything appears as it would in a regular multi-head
 configuration. If Xinerama is enabled (e.g., with +xinerama on the command

Description-md5: c5425cbd8103a5899200596c7a3c3033
Description-en: Xorg X server - development files
 This package provides development files for the X.Org ('Xorg') X server.
 This is not quite the same as the DDK (Driver Development Kit) from the
 XFree86 4.x and X.Org 6.7, 6.8 and 6.9 series of servers; it provides
 headers and a pkg-config file for drivers using autotools to build
 against.
 .
 Unless you are developing or building a driver, you probably want
 xserver-xorg and/or xserver-xorg-core instead.
 .

Package: xvfb
Description-md5: 1cd5b85acd06c23d376b7b5a7f30a0b8
Description-en: Virtual Framebuffer 'fake' X server
 Xvfb provides an X server that can run on machines with no display hardware
 and no physical input devices. It emulates a dumb framebuffer using virtual
 memory. The primary use of this server was intended to be server testing,
 but other novel uses for it have been found, including testing clients
 against unusual depths and screen configurations, doing batch processing with
 Xvfb as a background rendering engine, load testing, as an aid to porting the
 X server to a new platform, and providing an unobtrusive way to run
 applications that don't really need an X server but insist on having one
 anyway.
 .
 This package also contains a convenience script called xvfb-run which
 simplifies the automated execution of X clients in a virtual server
 environment. This convenience script requires the use of the xauth
 program.

Package: xorgxrdp
Description-md5: 56d1a375c74aae2447ed22baec7b766a
Description-en: Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) modules for X.org
 xorgxrdp is a set of drivers (screen device, keyboard, and mouse)
 for X.org enabling use through an RDP session with xrdp. For full
 operation, most standard X11 fonts and tools need to be installed;
 the Recommended xorg metapackage is a superset of what’s actually
 needed but will do.

Package: xrdp
Description-md5: 330bdf2ad3e2031a5164fd15aa25e2e9
Description-en: Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) server
 xrdp offers a graphical login to a remote client using
 RDP (the Remote Desktop Protocol). xrdp can connect to
 a locally created X.org session with the xorgxrdp drivers,
 to a VNC X11 server, and forward to another RDP server.
 .
 xrdp accepts connections from freerdp, rdesktop, and the
 built-in terminal server / remote desktop clients of
 Microsoft Windows operating systems.
 In the xorgxrdp (which replaces X11RDP) and VNC modes,
 it provides a fully functional Linux terminal server,
 offering an X-Window desktop to the user. In the RDP
 or VNC forwarding mode, any sort of desktop can be used.

Package: liblzma-dev
Description-md5: d19d3f899b3a1d8a68ae0473ad3f9283
Description-en: XZ-format compression library - development files
 XZ is the successor to the Lempel-Ziv/Markov-chain Algorithm
 compression format, which provides memory-hungry but powerful
 compression (often better than bzip2) and fast, easy decompression.
 .

 streams and the older LZMA format used by lzma. (For 7-Zip's related
 format, use the p7zip package instead.) This package provides the
 development library needed to build programs using liblzma.

Package: xz-utils
Description-md5: ea97a558c8575aebbed2c11cbd20e0f2
Description-en: XZ-format compression utilities
 XZ is the successor to the Lempel-Ziv/Markov-chain Algorithm
 compression format, which provides memory-hungry but powerful
 compression (often better than bzip2) and fast, easy decompression.
 .
 This package provides the command line tools for working with XZ
 compression, including xz, unxz, xzcat, xzgrep, and so on. They can
 also handle the older LZMA format, and if invoked via appropriate
 symlinks will emulate the behavior of the commands in the lzma
 package.
 .
 The XZ format is similar to the older LZMA format but includes some
 improvements for general use:
 .
  * 'file' magic for detecting XZ files;
  * crc64 data integrity check;
  * limited random-access reading support;
  * improved support for multithreading (not used in xz-utils);
  * support for flushing the encoder.

Package: xzdec
Description-md5: 30227ffce3f42144b3b624776f996bbf
Description-en: XZ-format compression utilities - tiny decompressors
 XZ is the successor to the Lempel-Ziv/Markov-chain Algorithm
 compression format, which provides memory-hungry but powerful
 compression (often better than bzip2) and fast, easy decompression.
 .
 This package provides the xzdec and lzmadec utilities, which write
 the decompressed version of a compressed file to standard output. The
 binaries are very small, so they can be easily stored on small media
 with some compressed files, and they are linked statically against
 liblzma so they can be used on machines without a compatible version
 of liblzma installed. However, they have:
 .
   * no compression support;
   * no support for writing to a file other than standard output;
   * no translated messages;
   * been optimized for size rather than speed.
 .
 For a full-featured xzcat command without these limitations, use
 the xz-utils package instead.
